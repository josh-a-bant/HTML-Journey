    <h1>Krishna</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <b>Krishna</b>(/ˈkrɪʃnə/;<sup>[13]</sup> Sanskrit: कृष्ण, IAST: Kṛṣṇa
      [ˈkr̩ʂɳɐ]) is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth
      avatar of Vishnu and also as the Supreme God in his own right.<sup
        >[14]</sup
      >
      He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love;<sup
        >[15][1]</sup
      >
      and is widely revered among Hindu divinities.<sup>[16]</sup> Krishna's
      birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami
      according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or
      early September of the Gregorian calendar.<sup>[17][18][19]</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as
      Krishna Līlā. He is a central figure in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata
      Purana, the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, and the Bhagavad Gita, and is
      mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological
      texts.<sup>[20]</sup> They portray him in various perspectives: as a
      god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and the universal
      supreme being.<sup>[21]</sup> His iconography reflects these legends and
      shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating
      butter, a young boy playing a flute, a handsome youth with Radha or
      surrounded by female devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to
      Arjuna.<sup>[22]</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      The name and synonyms of Krishna have been traced to 1st millennium BCE
      literature and cults.<sup>[23]</sup> In some sub-traditions, like
      Krishnaism, Krishna is worshipped as the Supreme God and Svayam Bhagavan
      (God Himself). These sub-traditions arose in the context of the medieval
      era Bhakti movement.<sup>[24][25]</sup> Krishna-related literature has
      inspired numerous performance arts such as Bharatanatyam, Kathakali,
      Kuchipudi, Odissi, and Manipuri dance.<sup>[26][27]</sup> He is a
      pan-Hindu god, but is particularly revered in some locations, such as
      Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh,<sup>[28]</sup> Dwarka and Junagadh in Gujarat;
      the Jagannatha aspect in Odisha, Mayapur in West Bengal;<sup
        >[24][29][30]</sup
      >
      in the form of Vithoba in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, Shrinathji at Nathdwara
      in Rajasthan,<sup>[24][31]</sup> Udupi Krishna in Karnataka,<sup
        >[32]</sup
      >
      Parthasarathy in Tamil Nadu, Aranmula and Guruvayoorappan (Guruvayoor) in
      Kerala.<sup>[33]</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the 1960s, the worship of Krishna has also spread to the Western
      world, largely due to the work of the International Society for Krishna
      Consciousness (ISKCON).<sup>[34]</sup>
